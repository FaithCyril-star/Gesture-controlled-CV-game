# Gesture-controlled-CV-game
A computer vision program that creates the classic pong game, where the paddle is controlled by your index finger.
The program uses mediapipe to track the index finger and set its x-cordinate position as the centre of the paddle.
Other functionalities were implemented with opencv.
